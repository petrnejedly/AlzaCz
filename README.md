## Solution overview

The solution is divided into following parts

## How to run the project

```
{
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "ConnectionStringAlzaWeb": "Data Source=IPADDRESS; Initial Catalog=CATALOG; User ID=USERID; Password=PASSWORD;"
    },
    "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
            "Default": "Information",
            "Microsoft": "Warning",
            "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
        }
